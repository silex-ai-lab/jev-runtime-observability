description: Resume or continue the dated work plan for jev-runtime-observability on any machine. Use when asked to resume the jev work plan (today's or a given day's), continue the todo list, pick the next task, or record progress for this project. Reads the newest plans/<date>.md in this skill, checks what this machine can run (Node, Kev, GPU class, PostgreSQL), runs the next open task, and writes status back so another machine can pick up where this one stopped.

# Resume the jev-runtime-observability work plan

## Where things stand (update this when a plan closes)

Last updated 2026-10-04, at jev `main` `efe3a9a` plus this skill update, silex-mockup `main` (after `c1ac048`, the card-order commit), ontology-typed-alerting `main` `a590e64`, and jev-simplified `main` `c073c61`. Nothing is in progress: no open branch, no undeployed change, no pending review. All repos are pushed, and their local `main` equals `origin/main`.

**Renamed 2026-09-30:** this repo was `jev-realtime-observability`. It is now `silex-ai-lab/jev-runtime-observability`, checked out at `~/workplace/Silex/jev-runtime-observability`. GitHub redirects the old URL.
- The live references were updated: `package.json`, READMEs, these skills, the deploy templates, the server banner, the guide, and the mockup's sync tool, `VENDORED.json` and READMEs.
- Dated `logs/`, `runs/` and the day plans keep the old name as written.
- An older clone only needs `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/silex-ai-lab/jev-runtime-observability.git`.

- **Day plans:**
  - No day plan is open.
  - [`plans/2026-09-30.md`](plans/2026-09-30.md) (N1–N6) is finished. Its one suggested follow-up is a 4B-specific fine-tune recipe, because the Kev-4B fine-tune (N2) did not match the 0.8B one on held-out goal_deviation.
  - [`plans/2026-09-29.md`](plans/2026-09-29.md) (T1–T10) is closed.
- **Done since then** (outside the day plans; each is a reviewed three-seat fleet run, recorded in `logs/` and listed in `logs/README.md`):
  1. **Sumo Logic demo:** SOC domain SOC1–SOC5, synthetic acceptance report, OTLP export. The run-book and talk track are in `docs/demo/SUMO_DEMO.md`.
     - The Sumo meeting is **Monday 2026-10-05**. Sumo is a prospect with no account, so the demo exports to the local OTLP sink.
     - Records: `logs/2026-09-29_SUMO_DEMO_PLAN.md`.
  2. **Console Runs view** (`logs/2026-09-30_CONSOLE_UX_PLAN.md`):
     - plain-language run cards, with the Engineer view still available underneath;
     - Re-check (`model_reeval`), Run again (`POST /v1/sandbox/reexec`) and What-if (`policy_only`, flags only);
     - the demo page's Live tab on the same layout;
     - `scripts/demo-up.sh` / `demo-down.sh`, which run the whole demo on a 24 GB Mac with Kev-0.8B (about 6 GB measured). See USER_MANUAL §0.
  3. **Demo page SOC agent** (`logs/2026-09-30_DEMO_SOC_PLAN.md`):
     - `/demo/index.html?domain=soc`, with an `AP | SOC` switch in the header;
     - SOC1–SOC5 are simulated with the console's rules;
     - SOC5 is the one labelled difference: synthetic `goal_deviation` scores hold the 2nd and 3rd suspensions for review, while the live console does not block SOC5.
  4. **silex-mockup integration** (`silex-mockup/logs/2026-09-30_JEV_RUNTIME_VALIDATION_PLAN.md`, deployed to https://silex-mockup.vercel.app/#view=runtime-observation):
     - the site's left nav has a **Runtime Observation** view, between Enterprise World Model and System Validation, that embeds this demo. It started as a System Validation tab and was moved by `silex-mockup/logs/2026-09-30_RUNTIME_OBSERVE_VIEW_PLAN.md`; the old `#view=long-term&tab=runtime` link redirects;
     - the demo is vendored byte-for-byte in `silex-mockup/jev-runtime/` (currently from `efe3a9a`);
     - this repo gained `?embed=1`, a validated `?back`, and the Runs view's `select(runId)`.
     - **Latest deploy:** silex-mockup `c1ac048` (2026-10-04), live read-back 9/9 (items 10 and 11 below). The view was first built as "Runtime Observe" and renamed to **Runtime Observation** at the user's request; its id and deep link are `runtime-observation`. The plan file keeps the old name (`RUNTIME_OBSERVE_VIEW_PLAN.md`), as dated records do. Every silex-mockup branch is merged into `main`.
     - **After any change to `web/demo`, `web/js/runs.js`, `verdict.js` or `web/css/runs.css`,** re-sync the mockup, then run its suites and deploy with the user's OK:

       ```bash
       node tools/sync-jev-runtime.mjs <this checkout> <commit>      # run in the silex-mockup repo
       node --test tests/site/*.test.mjs                            # 41/41 (includes the browser card probes)
       node tests/site/run-site-probes.mjs                          # 42/42
       ```

       Its integrity test fails on any local edit. A push to silex-mockup `main` is a public deploy (Vercel serves within about 15 s). Re-check the live site afterwards:

       ```bash
       node tests/site/run-site-probes.mjs --base https://silex-mockup.vercel.app   # 9/9 (S1, S3, S4, S5, S13, S14, S17, S20, S21)
       ```

     - The older AP-only `silex-mockup/jev-observability/` stays live, unchanged, and is marked superseded.
  5. **Plain-language guide** (Chinese, 13 screenshots; §9 is the Learning loop) to every demo page and the mockup's Runtime Observation view. Identical copies are in this repo (`docs/demo/guide/`) and in silex-mockup (`docs/jev-runtime-guide/`).
     - When the demo UI changes, retake the screenshots and update both copies together. The screenshots were taken with headless Chrome at 1440 × 900 through the Chrome DevTools Protocol; the helper script was a session scratch file and is not in either repo. Keep screenshots in the session scratch directory and show them inline. Do not copy screenshot sets to ~/Desktop; the user does not want them there.
     - Its numbers are simulated, with ±0.04 jitter, and the guide says so.
  6. **Learning loop showcase** (`logs/2026-09-30_LEARNING_LOOP_SHOWCASE_PLAN.md`, deployed 2026-10-01). The user called it the best selling point: "human judgment → align Kev to it → self-improving Kev".
     - **Demo:** a `?tab=learning` tab with **Play the loop**. A simulated logistic correction is trained on authored examples, then gated on 11 unseen variants per agent. By default, missed attacks fall 4/4 → 0/4 in both agents, actions sent to a person fall 3/10 → 1/10 (SOC), and one stays wrong.
     - **Measured card:** the real Kev-0.8B fine-tune, recall 0.40 → 0.80 at FPR 0.014 → 0.009 on held-out AgentDojo. It comes from `web/demo/data/learning-evidence.json`, generated by `eval/run/showcase-json.ts` and drift-tested. After re-running an eval, regenerate it, then re-sync the mockup.
     - **Honesty rules on every surface:** benchmark labels, not customer reviewers; LoRA, not RL; human-label training and production promotion are future work.
     - **Mockup:** Runtime Observation has a "The judge learns from your reviewers" card with **Try the loop** (S21).
  7. **silex-mockup floating left nav** (`silex-mockup/logs/2026-09-30_FLOATING_NAV_PLAN.md`, deployed 2026-09-30). The nav is hidden by default. A ChatGPT-style sidebar icon docks or hides it, the choice is remembered, and hovering the left edge peeks it. Probes: S20; `nav()` docks through the real icon.
  8. **Promotion gate and model history** (`logs/2026-10-01_LINEAGE_GATE_PLAN.md`, deployed 2026-10-01). These are ideas adapted from AutoScientists (mims-harvard), which has no RL.
     - **The gate:** one rule in `web/demo/js/learning/gate.js`. First a safety check (no rise in missed attacks or false holds), then an exact one-sided sign test on fixed vs broke at α = 0.05, giving KEEP, NEAR-MISS or DISCARD. Never call its p "the chance of luck".
     - **The demo:** Play runs three scripted rounds: NEAR-MISS (3 labels), then KEEP → v2 (18), then DISCARD (a careless batch raises false holds).
     - **The measured card:** Kev-0.8B fine-tuned KEEP (17/2); Kev-4B fine-tuned DISCARD by the safety check (missed 25 → 27).
     - **The generator** (`showcase-json.ts`) fails closed on malformed predictions.
     - **Possible next steps** (not started): a label critique gate (two-reviewer agreement); uncertainty-first review queue; a stop rule after N retrains without a KEEP.
  9. **jev-simplified: Jev linked to the Enterprise World Model ontology** (repo `silex-lab-ai/jev-simplified`, checked out at `~/workplace/Silex/jev-simplified`; plan and reviews in its `logs/2026-10-02_ONTOLOGY_LINK_PLAN.md`, r1–r5; Chinese summary in `logs/2026-10-02_SESSION_SUMMARY_ZH.md`). Pushed 2026-10-02; **no deployment is configured**.
     - **The user's rule:** for this work, change only that repo; the UI may be copied from silex-mockup (World Model and Runtime Observation).
     - **Structure:** a shell copied from the mockup with two views, Runtime Observation (the unchanged three-step SOC demo) and Enterprise World Model (Ontology Graph and Layers, adapted to a strict CSP).
     - **Ontology chips** on each decision ("Decided by" / "Also checked"), from `site/onto-link.js` and `site/ontology/jev-map.js`. The Jev ids are `attack` (with categories), `exfil`, `goal_deviation`, and the three rules.
     - **"Show what Jev checks at runtime"** toggle: highlights the mapped nodes and adds a SOC L4 overlay; at L4 it shows L3 context (SOC agent → INSTANCE_OF Planner ← THREATENS LLM01, AML.T0051 and T6, labelled Silex-authored relations).
     - **Inspector:** "Checked at runtime by Jev", with counts over the revealed events.
     - **Run and test:** `npm start` serves http://127.0.0.1:8771. `npm test` 40/40; `npm run check`; `npm run test:browser` 19/19 (server on 8771).
     - **Its own rules** (`logs/2026-10-01_MINIMAL_SITE_PLAN.md`): strict CSP (no inline style or script, no external fonts), no build step or npm deps; only `site/` is deployable.
     - **Next ideas, not chosen:** add Codex's degree-filter and reduced-motion probes to the browser suite; enlarge or auto-fit the L4 context cluster (it renders small in the default view).
  10. **Runtime Observation cleanup** (2026-10-04, at the user's request; not a fleet run):
     - "Scripted scenarios", "The judge learns from your reviewers", "What the ontology adds" and the new latency card start **collapsed**; the title toggles each (`silex-mockup/js/rt-fold.js`). `run-site-probes.mjs` opens them before probing. Card order (S21 checks it): Scripted scenarios, Decision plane (`#rtDecisionPlane`, the embedded demo, always open), The judge learns from your reviewers, What the ontology adds, How fast is the judge?
     - "What the ontology adds" shows Stage-1 (S1, confirmed on AgentDojo and scoped to it), the S2 replication on AgentDyn (not confirmed: the precision gain did not replicate; S2 also changed the binding procedure and used undefended models only, both tests share the AgentDojo harness, and S2 does not show typing is harmful in general; recall is an observation, not a guarantee), and example runs. It has a **Check Report** button to the demo artifact. The unconfirmed E-AL and E-PR results moved to `reports/UNCONFIRMED_TESTS.md` in https://github.com/silex-security/ontology-typed-alerting. Details: the `ontology-value-repro` skill § 7.
  11. **Measured judge latency, Kev vs gpt-4o-mini** (2026-10-04, `runs/latency-2026-10-04/`, Apple M4 Pro, same 708 eval items):
     - Kev-0.8B fine-tuned p50 152 ms / p95 347 ms (99 % within the 400 ms gate judge budget); gpt-4o-mini via the OpenAI API p50 670 ms / p95 990 ms (0.3 %). Runners: `eval/run/run-openai.ts`, summary `eval/run/latency-json.ts`.
     - **Mockup card** "How fast is the judge?" (`js/rt-latency.js`, `data/judge-latency.json`, probe `tests/site/judge-latency-card.test.mjs` 8/8): p50 tiles, a 400 ms budget line, and a 10 s real-time replay of the measured round trips. It says gpt-4o was not measured and that it compares speed, not quality.
     - **Demo latency model:** the Jev step is drawn from Kev's measured quantiles (top at p98 = 386 ms so no draw crosses the deadline), serialise/redact is 10–30 ms for a local judge, and the async LLM slow path follows gpt-4o-mini's quantiles. Gate p50 fell from about 303 ms to 190 ms over seeds 1–50. The headline tile is now **p50** added gate latency. The tables in `web/demo/js/engine/types.js` are drift-tested by `tests/unit/web/demo-latency-quantiles.test.ts`.
     - To re-measure on another host, see the deploy skill § 8. The published numbers stay pinned to this run unless the user asks.
- **Open follow-ups** (non-blocking review notes, not done; details at the end of each log):
  - **Console** (`CONSOLE_UX_PLAN` code gate):
    - `/v1/sandbox/reexec` takes its rate slot before the run lookup;
    - the compatibility `/v1/replays kind: sandbox_reexec` path skips the sandbox budget;
    - What-if only reaches the ≤ 50 runs the Runs view keeps;
    - Run again jumps to the new run, so its "started" note is not seen.
  - **Demo SOC:**
    - the `QUESTIONS_BY_AGENT` lookup should use `Object.hasOwn`;
    - separate stop and watch counters for mixed-mode runs.
  - **Model:** the 4B fine-tune recipe (above).
  - **Learning loop and gate** (`LINEAGE_GATE_PLAN` code gate):
    - the presenter cadence is a fixed 1 s per stage;
    - the three rounds reuse one small authored held-out set (disclosed on the page);
    - production promotion and training on human labels are not built.
  - **Mockup Runtime Observation view:** every Run waits for the six-step animation (about 1.6 s), even when the frame is ready. That is fine for a demo; a faster path is possible.
- **silex-mockup** (`~/workplace/Silex/silex-mockup`, https://github.com/silex-security/silex-mockup):
  - serve it locally with `python3 -m http.server 8797 --bind 127.0.0.1`;
  - tests: `node --test tests/site/*.test.mjs` (41/41) and `node tests/site/run-site-probes.mjs` (42/42).
- **Test baseline at this skill update** (`efe3a9a` plus the latency drift test):
  - `npm test`: 322 tests, 318 pass, 0 fail, 4 skip; with `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, 1 skip.
  - Probes, which need a Kev on 8010 (0.8B) or 8009:

    | command | expected |
    |---|---|
    | `npm run probe` (`KEV_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8010 KEV_EXPECT=jaredpalmer/kev-0.8b`) | 8/8 |
    | `node tests/probe/soc-probes.ts` | 7/7 |
    | `node tests/probe/ui-runs-probes.ts` | 29/29 |
    | `node tests/probe/demo-probes.ts` | 24/24 |

## Quick resume on a new host

```bash
git clone https://github.com/silex-ai-lab/jev-runtime-observability.git && cd jev-runtime-observability
npm ci && npm run typecheck && npm test          # expect 0 fail; 4 skips are normal without PostgreSQL
bash skills/jev-work-plan/scripts/resume-check.sh # what this host can run, and the open tasks
bash scripts/demo-up.sh                            # the whole demo (Kev-0.8B, two consoles, OTLP sink); stop with demo-down.sh
```

- **Consoles:**
  - gate: http://127.0.0.1:8791/
  - watch-only: http://127.0.0.1:8790/
- **Demo page:**
  - AP: http://127.0.0.1:8791/demo/index.html
  - SOC: http://127.0.0.1:8791/demo/index.html?domain=soc

**On another machine,** clone silex-mockup next to this repo (`git clone https://github.com/silex-security/silex-mockup.git ../silex-mockup`) if the work touches the demo, since its vendored copy must be re-synced.

Then pick the next work:
- **Meeting prep:** rehearse `docs/demo/SUMO_DEMO.md` before 2026-10-05, including optional beat 7a (Learning loop: Play the loop, then the green card's "Would this gate promote it?"). Take a follow-up from the list above only if the user asks.
- **Next ideas from AutoScientists**, offered to the user and not yet chosen:
  1. a label critique gate (a second reviewer must agree before a label trains);
  2. an uncertainty-first review queue (active learning: the least certain actions reach reviewers first);
  3. a stop rule (after N retrains without a KEEP, stop and ask a human).

  Each goes through the usual plan → review → build → review fleet run, with Codex building.
- **New day plan:** create `plans/<date>.md` from the follow-ups above, with the user's priorities. The 4B fine-tune needs 32 GB+ Apple Silicon or a datacenter GPU, plus the Kev checkout at `~/workplace/Silex/third_party/kev` (deploy skill step 3).

**Fleet notes** (`herdr-agent-fleet`):
- **Staffing:** on 2026-10-01 the user said to give Codex more of the build; on 2026-10-02, "if GPT is running out of tokens", to move coding to Claude and DeepSeek. At that point Codex's weekly limit was about 9 %: use it for brief reviews only until it resets (check `/status` in its pane). DeepSeek handles mechanical slices. Between unrelated tasks, start fresh sessions (`/new` in both panes).
- **Codex outside its workspace:** when its pane runs in silex-mockup and the work is in the jev repo, it stages files in /tmp and installs them with a script. Read the script before approving; it should only copy assigned paths.
- **Approval watcher:** a session-scratch `watch.sh` polled both panes and approved only matching prompts: DeepSeek file access under the scratch directory or the repo, and Codex commands matching an allow-list regex. It is not in either repo; rewrite it if needed. Two quirks:
  - Herdr sometimes reports `blocked` while the agent is working. Act only when the screen shows "Would you like" or "Permission required".
  - Codex's `/new` asks "Where should the new conversation run?"; Enter keeps the current checkout.
- **Gate rule for the user:** "评审通过后直接开工，做完截图给我看" — once review passes, start building and show screenshots at the end. Deploying to silex-mockup `main` still needs the user's explicit OK each time.
- **Check exit codes directly.** `cmd | tail -1 && git commit` commits even when `cmd` fails, because the pipe's status is `tail`'s. That happened once on 2026-09-30 (jev `60b99da`). Use `cmd > log; echo exit=$?`.
- **Codex in its sandbox:**
  - It asks before writing files outside its working repo (silex-mockup) and before running probe runners on localhost. Approve its own assigned files and runner prefix only.
  - Its session can drop mid-review ("Conversation interrupted"). Re-prompt it with the findings it already printed.
- OpenCode's permission prompt wraps the path across lines. To auto-approve scratch reads, strip newlines and the box characters before matching the scratch path.
- A domain or UI change to the demo keeps AP behaviour pinned by `tests/fixtures/demo-ap-envelopes.json`. Re-capture it only from unchanged code (`tests/fixtures/capture-demo-ap.mjs`).

## How the plans work

The plans live in this skill's `plans/` folder, one file per day, named `YYYY-MM-DD.md`. **The plan file is the state.** Git is the only thing shared between machines, so whatever is not written into the plan file and pushed is lost to the next machine.

## 1. Find the plan

- If the user names a date, open `plans/<date>.md`.
- Otherwise open the newest file in `plans/`.
- Read it in full: the **Context** section, the task table and the **Log** at the bottom.

## 2. Check the machine

```bash
bash skills/jev-work-plan/scripts/resume-check.sh
```

The script:
- checks Node ≥ 23.6;
- checks that `origin` is the renamed repo. An old clone fails with the fix: `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/silex-ai-lab/jev-runtime-observability.git`. It also warns about an old folder name, and fails on skill links in `~/.claude/skills` / `~/.codex/skills` that point to the old path;
- runs `git fetch` and says whether the local branch is behind or ahead of `origin`;
- checks `node_modules`, `.env`, and whether Kev answers on 8009 and 8010;
- checks the Kev checkout and its pinned commit (`3e1cd3b`);
- checks the hardware against the `gpu` bar (Apple Silicon RAM ≥ 32 GB, or an NVIDIA GPU);
- checks for PostgreSQL, Docker and `TEST_DATABASE_URL` (`pg`), and for GNU `timeout`. Without it, `finetune.sh` uses `eval/finetune/timebox.pl`;
- lists the open tasks from the newest plan (any `| <letter><number> |` row not `done`).

Then fix what it reports:
- **`origin` still uses the old name** (`jev-realtime-observability`): `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/silex-ai-lab/jev-runtime-observability.git`, then `git fetch`. If the folder still has the old name, renaming it is optional; if you do, re-link the skills with `ln -sfn <new path>/skills/<skill> ~/.claude/skills/<skill>`.
- **Behind `origin`:** `git pull --ff-only` before anything else.
- **No `node_modules`:** `npm ci`.
- **No `.env`:** it is never in git. Create it from `deploy/env.example` with fresh random keys. The steps are in `skills/deploy-jev-observability/SKILL.md` step 4.
- **No Kev:** only the tasks marked `needs: kev` require it. Start it with `skills/deploy-jev-observability/SKILL.md` step 3. By convention:
  - Kev-4B on 8009;
  - Kev-0.8B on 8010;
  - an ad-hoc fine-tuned model on 8011 (`KEV_RUN=$PWD/runs/ft-…/model`).

  The probes check the served identity: `KEV_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8010 KEV_EXPECT=jaredpalmer/kev-0.8b npm run probe`.

### Capability decisions that need the user

- **Under the `gpu` bar:** don't substitute a smaller model (Kev-0.8B for Kev-4B) without asking. On 2026-09-29 the user said yes for that run only.
- **Installing anything:** PostgreSQL, Docker, Homebrew packages or Python packages beyond `uv sync` in the Kev checkout. Ask first.
- **Product decisions:** anything the plan lists under "Needs a user decision first".

Before starting, run `npm run typecheck && npm test`; it must be green. If it is red on a fresh clone, record that in the Log and fix it first.

## 3. Pick and run a task

- Take the first task whose status is `todo` and whose `needs` this machine meets. Mark it `doing (<host>, <date>)`, commit and push the plan file. That tells other machines it is taken.
- Stay inside the task's file list. Check its acceptance criteria literally.
- **Every number in a doc is generated, never typed** (this repo drift-tests generated blocks).
- **Never commit `.env`, `.data/`, raw eval data or model weights** (see `.gitignore`).
- Commit with a message naming the task id, for example `T4: review queue API`.

## 4. Record state after every task (not only at the end)

In the plan file:
- set the task's status to `done (<short sha>)`, `blocked: <reason>` or `partial: <what is left>`;
- append a Log line: date, host, task, what changed, test result (pass/fail/skip counts), and anything the next machine must know.

Then commit the plan file together with the code and **push**. If the session may end at any moment, a pushed `partial:` is worth more than an unpushed `done`.

## 5. When the day's plan is finished or abandoned

Leave unfinished tasks as `todo` or `partial:`. The next day's plan copies them forward and adds a link back to this file.

## Rules learned on 2026-09-29

- **Never edit a script while a job started from it is still running.** Bash reads scripts as it executes. An edit to `finetune.sh` mid-run broke its epilogue, and the fine-tune's exit code was lost. Put a fix in a new file, or wait for the job to end.
- **Long jobs:**
  - run them in the background with their own record directory (`runs/<kind>-<date>/`);
  - stop the Kev judge before a fine-tune, since both use the same GPU;
  - serve a fine-tuned model alone for its eval.
- **A time-out, an OOM or a failure is a result.** Record it in the run's `RUN.txt` and the Log. Don't hide it or retry silently.
- **Label exports hold tenant data.** Inside the repo, write them only under `runs/exports/`, where `.gitignore` covers every JSONL at any depth.
- **Before pushing a reviewed change,** check that the code equals what reviewers approved. `git diff <base> <approved-commit> | git hash-object --stdin` must equal the reviewed revision, and only record files may differ after it. Quote pathspecs like `':!logs'`; an unquoted one silently makes `git diff` print nothing.
- **Fleet runs** (`herdr-agent-fleet`): OpenCode asks for access to the review scratch directory on each read. Answer "Allow once" after checking the path. Codex asks to run tests outside its sandbox, because they bind 127.0.0.1. Approve each test command once.

## Rules that carry over from the build

- Push to `main` only with a green `npm test`. Larger changes (a new API, a migration, a UI panel) may use a branch and the three-seat review from the `herdr-agent-fleet` skill, if that machine has it. Otherwise note in the Log that the change was not reviewed.
- Semantic signals stay `experimental`: no task may let a judge signal block or change a live recommendation unless its plan entry says so explicitly.
- Login is optional (`AUTH_MODE=none` by default, loopback only). New endpoints must go through `auth()` with the correct roles, so that `AUTH_MODE=keys` keeps working, and they need a test in keys mode.
