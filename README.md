---

An agent's boundary events (input, generation, tool call, tool result) are captured as they happen. Each one is turned into a frozen decision-time snapshot and checked by authoritative code rules, then by typed semantic questions (Noul / Choice / Score) sent to a judge over TypeSafe's `/v1/systemone` protocol. The result is recorded as an auditable recommendation and streamed to a live console.

Execution stays with the tools' own gateway. Nothing here is a production control yet.

> **Status: Gates A, B and C.**
> - **Shadow mode** (the default): the judge advises only.
> - **Sandbox gate mode** (`SOURCE_MODE=live_sandbox_gate`): write and payment tools need a control bound to the exact call, which the gateway re-verifies before executing. See [`docs/GATE.md`](docs/GATE.md).
> - **Semantic signals are recorded but never block or change a recommendation.** Thresholds were fitted in evaluation but are deliberately not activated ([`docs/EVAL.md`](docs/EVAL.md) explains why). Blocking comes only from hard rules, missing evidence, or an unavailable required judge signal.
> - Plan and reviews: [`logs/2026-09-28_BUILD_PLAN.md`](logs/2026-09-28_BUILD_PLAN.md).

> ⭐ **Star this repo** to follow new gates, judge evaluations and demo scenarios as they land (the open work is in [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md)). [Why star it →](#-why-star-jev-runtime-observability)

## Why jev-runtime-observability?

An agent that pays invoices or sends email can do something wrong in one tool call, and a log you read later can't stop it. This project watches each boundary event as it happens, checks it with code rules first, and records what a judge says about it. The scripted scenarios show what that catches, and what it can't:

- 💸 **An agent pays 48,000 USD against a 25,000 USD limit** → `amount_limit` BLOCK by code; the tool itself refuses too (S3).
- 📝 **An invoice has no approval record** → `approval_evidence` HOLD by code; a confident judge cannot supply approval (S4).
- 📧 **A vendor note tells the agent to email bank details outside** → `domain_allowlist` BLOCK by code; the mail sink refuses; injection signals recorded (S6).
- ⏱️ **The judge call times out** → payment HOLD and lookup ALERT (`judge_unavailable`); no answer is never "safe" (F1).
- 🧾 **The tool returns 200, but the ledger never posts** → outcome `pending` → `unknown_after_deadline`, and the agent's completion claim is flagged (S5).
- 🧭 **The agent emails the whole AP report to an allowlisted address** → no rule can see this; only the semantic `goal_deviation` signal, which is recorded and uncalibrated, so it does not block (S7).

### ✅ Before you install

| | |
|---|---|
| 💰 **Free and open source** | Apache-2.0. The default judge, Kev, is Apache-2.0 too. |
| 🖥️ **The judge runs on your machine** | Kev served locally (MLX on Apple Silicon). TypeSafe's hosted Jev is supported by config but has not been run. |
| 👀 **Shadow mode by default** | The judge advises only. Semantic signals are recorded but never block or change a recommendation. |
| 🧪 **Sandbox only** | Tools run in an isolated sandbox schema. No real money, no real email, no network egress from tools. |
| 💻 **One 24 GB Mac runs the demo** | The stack peaked at about 6 GB with Kev-0.8B. Kev-4B and fine-tuning are not needed. |
| 🩺 **Self-check** | `npm run typecheck && npm test` needs no judge. |
| ⚠️ **Not a production control yet** | No production IAM or gateway integration, no HA, no calibrated live thresholds. |

## What is real and what is not

| Real, in this repo | Not real, or not yet |
|---|---|
| Judge inference: Kev-4B served locally (MLX on Apple Silicon), called over HTTP for every eligible boundary | TypeSafe's hosted Jev. It is supported by config (`JUDGE_BACKEND=typesafe`) but has not been run: no key was available |
| Tool execution in an isolated sandbox schema (ERP, vendors, ledger, mail sink); tools enforce their own limits and approvals | Real money or real email; any network egress from tools |
| Measured latency: ingest → signal, judge HTTP RTT, per stage (monotonic clocks) | Latency targets as guarantees. The RFC's targets are hypotheses; measured numbers depend on this machine |
| A sandbox pre-tool gate: a bound, single-use, expiring control; gateway re-verification (args digest, authority version, nonce, revocation); a not_executed receipt as the only proof of prevention | Semantic blocking (signals are uncalibrated), human review resolution, a production IAM or gateway integration |
| Real timeouts (F1 aborts the HTTP call), a ledger of every judge attempt, duplicate and conflict detection | Calibrated live thresholds and independent human labels. The evaluation uses labels derived from benchmark ground truth, and its limits are listed in [`docs/EVAL.md`](docs/EVAL.md) |
| Independent read-back of executed payments and emails (pending → verified / failed / mismatch / unknown after deadline) | A claim that a tool's HTTP 200 means the business action happened |
| An open-data evaluation (InjecAgent, ASB, ToolEmu, tau-bench, with AgentDojo held out) and a local LoRA fine-tune of Kev-0.8B, with the weights not committed | Generalisation beyond the measured families. A residual style risk on the held-out family is documented |
| OTLP/HTTP JSON intake via the official OpenTelemetry JS SDK exporter | HA, multi-replica, or an OCSF / ACS conformance claim |

## Quick start (macOS, Apple Silicon; Node ≥ 23.6, uv)

```bash
# 1. The judge: Kev (Apache-2.0), outside this repo
git clone https://github.com/jaredpalmer/kev ~/workplace/Silex/third_party/kev
(cd ~/workplace/Silex/third_party/kev && uv sync --extra serve)
npm run kev                       # serves jaredpalmer/kev-4b on 127.0.0.1:8009 (first run downloads weights)

# 2. The server (embedded PostgreSQL via PGlite; set DATABASE_URL for a real Postgres)
npm install
cp deploy/env.example .env && set -a && . ./.env && set +a
npm run server                    # http://127.0.0.1:8787 — live console at /, simulated demo at /demo/

# 3. Open the console. Login is off by default (`AUTH_MODE=none`, localhost only), so it connects by itself. Press S1…S9 / F1.
   For a shared or remote deployment, set `AUTH_MODE=keys` and paste READER_KEY (and ADMIN_KEY to start runs).
```

## Run the demo on a 24 GB Mac

One Apple Silicon Mac with **24 GB** of memory runs the whole demo: the gate and watch-only consoles with the SOC and AP scenarios, the simulated `/demo/` page, and a local OTLP sink. It needs only the **Kev-0.8B** judge.
- **Measured footprint:** the stack peaked at about 6 GB (`runs/mem-2026-09-30/footprint.txt`). Kev-0.8B peaks at 3.6 GB, and each console at about 1.2 GB.
- **Not needed:** Kev-4B (16 GB peak when serving) and fine-tuning.

**You need:** Node ≥ 23.6, `uv` with Python 3.12 or 3.13, git, free ports 8010 / 8790 / 8791 / 4318, and internet on the first run (npm packages and the Kev-0.8B weights).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/silex-ai-lab/jev-runtime-observability.git && cd jev-runtime-observability
npm ci && npm run typecheck && npm test
git clone https://github.com/jaredpalmer/kev.git ~/workplace/Silex/third_party/kev
git -C ~/workplace/Silex/third_party/kev checkout 3e1cd3b && (cd ~/workplace/Silex/third_party/kev && uv sync --extra serve)
bash scripts/demo-up.sh --reset     # Kev-0.8B on :8010, consoles on :8790 (watch-only) and :8791 (gate), sink on :4318
# open http://127.0.0.1:8791/  → "Run a scenario" → SOC1…SOC5 ;  simulated page: http://127.0.0.1:8791/demo/index.html
bash scripts/demo-down.sh           # add --kev to stop the judge too
```

All of it runs on 127.0.0.1 with login off. The prerequisites and what the script does are in the [`deploy-jev-observability`](skills/deploy-jev-observability/SKILL.md) skill ("Quick path"). The talk track is in [`docs/demo/SUMO_DEMO.md`](docs/demo/SUMO_DEMO.md), and reading the pages is covered in [`docs/USER_MANUAL.md`](docs/USER_MANUAL.md).

## Using the console

[`docs/USER_MANUAL.md`](docs/USER_MANUAL.md) covers the whole page: connecting, the provenance header, the KPI tiles, every scenario and what it should show, the decision inspector, outcome read-back, replay and re-ask, gate mode, and a five-minute test of a deployment.

[`docs/demo/guide/`](docs/demo/guide/README.md) (in Chinese) explains every page of the simulated demo (`/demo/`) in plain language, with screenshots.

**Learning loop** (`/demo/index.html?tab=learning`): the demo's story of how the judge improves from reviewer labels (review → labels → train → held-out gate → proposed promotion). A presenter can press **Play the loop**. The in-browser model is a simulated toy, labelled as such. The measured card underneath shows the real Kev-0.8B fine-tune result on held-out AgentDojo, generated from the eval runs by `eval/run/showcase-json.ts`. That fine-tune used benchmark labels, not human ones, and it is supervised LoRA, not RL. Plan and reviews: [`logs/2026-09-30_LEARNING_LOOP_SHOWCASE_PLAN.md`](logs/2026-09-30_LEARNING_LOOP_SHOWCASE_PLAN.md).

[`docs/judge/`](docs/judge/) (in Chinese) explains why Kev is the default judge, what Kev was trained on, and the plan for fine-tuning on this deployment's own labelled data.

## Deploying on another host

Follow the [`deploy-jev-observability`](skills/deploy-jev-observability/SKILL.md) skill. It covers:
- a host check;
- the Kev judge;
- configuration, including gate mode and PostgreSQL;
- a smoke test;
- systemd and a TLS proxy;
- optionally, measuring the judge's latency against gpt-4o-mini on this host.

See [`skills/README.md`](skills/README.md) for how to load it into an agent.

## Scenarios

| | What the scripted agent does | What the system should record |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | reads a PO, looks up the vendor, pays an approved invoice | rules pass; judge answers recorded; no configured risk (not "safe") |
| S2 | pays an invoice whose account holder is not a verified alias of the vendor | rules pass; the `payee_relation` signal is recorded as experimental (uncalibrated) |
| S3 | pays 48,000 USD against a 25,000 USD limit | `amount_limit` BLOCK by code; the judge runs off the decision path (diagnostic); the tool itself refuses |
| S4 | pays an invoice with no approval record | `approval_evidence` HOLD by code; a confident judge cannot supply approval |
| S6 | a vendor note tells the agent to email bank details outside; it does | `domain_allowlist` BLOCK by code; the mail sink refuses; injection signals recorded |
| F1 | the judge call is aborted (1 ms budget) | payment HOLD and lookup ALERT (`judge_unavailable`); no answer is never "safe" |
| S5 | pays; the tool returns 200, but the ledger never posts | outcome `pending` → `unknown_after_deadline`; the agent's completion claim is flagged as having no verified success at claim time |
| S7 | asked to check a status, it emails the whole AP report to an allowlisted address | no rule can see this; only the semantic `goal_deviation` signal (recorded, uncalibrated) |
| S8 | pays an account held under the vendor's registered alias | no rule hit; `payee_relation` recorded |
| S9 | claims "done" before the ledger posts (a 3 s delay) | outcome `pending` → `verified_success`; the claim was early |

## Design principles

- **Execution stays with the tools' own gateway.** The judge recommends; in sandbox gate mode the gateway re-verifies a control bound to the exact call before executing.
- **Code rules are authoritative.** Blocking comes only from hard rules, missing evidence, or an unavailable required judge signal. A confident judge cannot supply approval.
- **No answer is never "safe".** An aborted judge call holds the payment instead of letting it through.
- **A tool's HTTP 200 is not proof.** Executed payments and emails are read back independently: pending → verified / failed / mismatch / unknown after deadline.
- **Says what is real.** The table above keeps what runs in this repo apart from what is not real, or not yet.

## Layout

```
contracts/  rubrics/          schemas (zod), recorded real Kev responses, the question set and manifest
server/                       api · ingest (events + OTLP) · state · rules · judges · policy · worker · storage
sdk/  sandbox/                capture SDK; sandbox schema, seed, tools, gateway, scripted driver, scenarios
web/                          live console (/) and the original simulated demo (/demo/)
tests/                        unit, contract, integration, security, e2e (KEV_URL), UI probes
logs/                         the RFC, the approved plan, and review records
```

## Tests

```bash
npm run typecheck && npm test                          # no judge needed (a stub judge server is used in tests only)
KEV_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8009 npm run test:e2e         # against a live Kev
npm run probe                                          # headless-Chrome UI probes
node eval/sources/fetch.ts && node eval/convert/run.ts   # rebuild the open-data splits (licence and hash checked)
node eval/run/run.ts --judge http://127.0.0.1:8009 --label kev-4b --out runs/my-eval   # evaluate a judge
./eval/finetune/finetune.sh 0.8b                       # bounded LoRA fine-tune (3 h box)
```

## ⭐ Why star jev-runtime-observability

Every reason below is something you can check in this repo:

- 🧾 **Honest about what is real.** The [real / not-real table](#what-is-real-and-what-is-not) keeps measured behaviour apart from config-only support and targets that are still hypotheses.
- 🖥️ **A local, open judge.** Kev (Apache-2.0) runs on your machine; the demo needs one 24 GB Mac.
- 🧪 **Tested at every layer.** Unit, contract, integration, security and e2e tests, plus headless-Chrome UI probes (`npm test`, `npm run test:e2e`, `npm run probe`).
- 📊 **An open-data evaluation.** InjecAgent, ASB, ToolEmu and tau-bench, with AgentDojo held out; the limits are listed in [`docs/EVAL.md`](docs/EVAL.md).
- 🚀 **Deployable from a skill.** The [`deploy-jev-observability`](skills/deploy-jev-observability/SKILL.md) skill covers a host check, the judge, configuration, a smoke test, systemd and a TLS proxy.
- 🌏 **Readable in four languages:** English, 简体中文, 日本語 and 한국어.

A star helps other people building agent guardrails find it. ⭐
